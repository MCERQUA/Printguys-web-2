## Performance Optimization Complete

I've successfully optimized the Next.js app with the following improvements:

### 1. **Image Optimization** (next.config.ts)
- Added AVIF and WebP format support
- Configured device and image sizes for responsive images
- Added AVIF to cache headers
- Enabled image optimization with `unoptimized: false`
- Added caching for `/_next/static/` assets

### 2. **Lazy Loading for Images**
- **Portfolio page**: Added `loading="lazy"`, `placeholder="blur"`, and `blurDataURL` to all portfolio gallery images
- **Portfolio lightbox**: Added `loading="lazy"` and `priority={false}` for lightbox images
- **Footer**: Added `loading="lazy"` to footer logo
- **Export modal**: Added `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` to preview images

### 3. **Dynamic Imports for Heavy Components**
- **Design Studio page**: Added dynamic import with:
  - Custom loading spinner while component loads
  - `ssr: false` since it requires browser APIs (canvas, file upload)
  - Reduces initial bundle size significantly

### 4. **Fetch Priority Optimization**
- **Header logo**: Added `fetchPriority="high"` and `priority` for above-the-fold logo

### 5. **Performance Headers** (next.config.ts)
- Added `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` security header
- Enhanced caching for images and static assets
- Added compression with `compress: true`
- Enabled SWC minification for faster builds
- Enabled React Strict Mode for better development

### Files Modified:
1. `next.config.ts` - Enhanced image config and headers
2. `src/components/design-studio/export-modal.tsx` - Added lazy loading
3. `src/app/design-studio/page.tsx` - Added dynamic import
