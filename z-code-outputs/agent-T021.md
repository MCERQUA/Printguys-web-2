TASK_COMPLETED

I have successfully completed Task T021: Add LocalBusiness Schema Markup. Here's what was accomplished:

**Created:**
- `/src/components/seo/schema-markup.tsx` - A comprehensive schema component with 4 exports:
  - `LocalBusinessSchema` - Full business information
  - `FAQSchema` - Dynamic FAQ markup
  - `BreadcrumbSchema` - Breadcrumb navigation
  - `ProductSchema` - Product/service markup

**Updated:**
- `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added LocalBusinessSchema to all pages
- `/src/app/faq/page.tsx` - Added FAQSchema for all 18 FAQs
- 8 service pages with BreadcrumbSchema (DTF, Screen Printing, Embroidery, Sublimation, Large Format, UV DTF Stickers, Vinyl Banners, Safety Wear)

**SEO Benefits:**
- Enhanced search engine understanding
- Rich snippets potential
- Improved local SEO
